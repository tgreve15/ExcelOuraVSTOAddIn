Contained here are the compiled releases of this Excel Add-In. I suggest downloading the latest one and installing that 
on your machine with Excel already installed to have the latest functionality and set of bug fixes.

You will need to extract the files from the .ZIP to a folder on your computer, and run the setup.exe program from there.
Alternatively if you have Visual Studio, feel free to build this yourself using the source code included in this project.

If you experience any problems, or have any requests or suggestions, please raise them in the issues and I will get to
them as I am able.
